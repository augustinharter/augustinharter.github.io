# Research Projects

## Modular Recursive Routing Network
Inspired by the brains modular cortical column structure: A network made of sub networks that share and route activations via attention mechanisms.

## Unsupervised Segmentation of Reward Related Objects
![segmentation gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndrwmlnk/critic-guided-segmentation-of-rewarding-objects-in-first-person-views/main/imgs/results.gif)

Learning segmentation masks for reward related objects to enrich the observations fed to a RL policy. This work helped to achieve the 1st place in the [2020 MineRL competition](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2020-minerl-competition).

## A deep learning architecture for solving physics mirroring an intuitive reasoning process
![PHYRE gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ndrwmlnk/PHYRE-Reasoning-about-Paths/main/imgs/phyre_tasks.gif)

Modeling my chain of reasoning while solving above physics puzzles as a sequence of encoder decoder models. Big part of my Bachelor Thesis and accepted 2020 at the 1st NeurIPS Workshop on Interpretable Inductive Biases and Physically Structured Learning.

# Philosophy
Sometimes I write texts about [my understanding of reality](https://augustinharter.github.io/patterns-of-meaning/consciousness).
