I enjoy attempts to understand reality. I'm fascinated by the nature of intelligence and its implementation in the brain and deep learning.

## Completed Research Projects

### A deep learning architecture for solving physics mirroring an intuitive reasoning process
[Link to project github](https://github.com/ndrwmlnk/PHYRE-Reasoning-about-Paths)

The idea was to quite naivly model my chain of reasoning while solving certain physics puzzle as a sequence of encoder decoder models. Big part of my Bachelor Thesis and accepted at a NeurIPS 2020 Workshop.
